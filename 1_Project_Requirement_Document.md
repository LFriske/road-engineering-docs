# Project Requirement Document (PRD) - road.engineering

## Project Purpose

The road.engineering website is designed to provide an interactive platform for visualizing and analyzing road safety data across Queensland, Australia. The site leverages official Queensland Government datasets (crash data and Average Annual Daily Traffic) to present this information in an accessible, user-friendly format that enables users to identify patterns, trends, and high-risk areas on Queensland roads.

By integrating these datasets into a single interactive interface, the platform aims to improve road safety awareness, support informed decision-making, and facilitate the generation of detailed crash reports for specific road segments or areas.

## Target Audience

The road.engineering platform is designed to serve:

- **Road Safety Analysts**: Professionals who need detailed crash data analysis and visualization for research, policy development, and intervention planning.
- **Urban and Transport Planners**: Individuals working on road network improvements, traffic management, and urban development projects.
- **Government Officials**: Decision-makers at local, state, and federal levels who require evidence-based data for road safety policy and infrastructure spending.
- **Engineering Consultants**: Professionals working on road design, safety audits, and infrastructure recommendations.
- **Academic Researchers**: Those studying traffic patterns, road safety interventions, and transport system optimization.
- **General Public**: Road users interested in understanding safety conditions of their regular routes or areas of concern.

## Core Features

### 1. Interactive Map Visualization

- Display an interactive map of Queensland with clear visualization of crash locations using color-coded markers to represent crash severity (Fatal, Serious, Minor).
- Display Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) data as visual indicators that convey traffic volume.
- Include live traffic data where available to show current conditions and incidents.
- Implement map navigation with standard controls (zoom, pan, etc.) and responsive design for various device sizes.
- Enable toggling between different data layers (crash data, AADT data, traffic incidents).

### 2. Road Selection and Filtering

- Allow users to select specific roads or road segments through direct map interaction (clicking/selecting).
- Implement search functionality to find roads by name, ID, or geographic area.
- Enable filtering of displayed data by:
  - Date range (from 2001 to 2023)
  - Crash severity
  - Road type
  - Vehicle types involved
  - Time of day
  - Weather conditions
  - Contributing factors

### 3. Crash Data Report Generation

- Generate detailed reports for selected road segments containing:
  - Summary statistics (total crashes, breakdown by severity, trends over time)
  - Detailed crash listings with date, time, severity, and location
  - Contributing factors analysis
  - Weather and road condition analysis
  - Vehicle types involved
  - Crash types (e.g., head-on, rear-end)
  - Temporal analysis (time of day, day of week, monthly/seasonal patterns)
- Provide downloadable reports in multiple formats (PDF, CSV)
- Include data visualizations within reports (charts, graphs, heat maps)

### 4. Data Integration

- Seamlessly integrate Queensland Government datasets:
  - [Queensland Road Crash Database](https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/crash-data-from-queensland-roads)
  - [Queensland Traffic Census (AADT) Data](https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/traffic-census-for-the-queensland-state-declared-road-network)
- Implement regular data updates and synchronization with source datasets
- Provide clear indications of data currency and preliminary status where applicable

## Success Metrics

The success of the road.engineering platform will be measured by:

### User Engagement
- Number of unique visitors per month
- Average session duration
- Number of reports generated
- Return visitor rate
- Feature utilization rates

### Data Quality and Performance
- Data accuracy (validated against Queensland Government datasets)
- Data freshness (time between source data updates and platform updates)
- Website performance metrics:
  - Page load time (target: under 3 seconds)
  - Map rendering time (target: under 2 seconds)
  - Report generation time (target: under 5 seconds)

### User Satisfaction
- User feedback ratings
- Feature request tracking
- Error reporting rates
- Support ticket volume and resolution metrics

## Project Constraints

### Data Limitations
- Reliance on Queensland Government datasets and their update frequency
- Preliminary data status for the most recent 12 months of crash data
- Potential gaps in AADT coverage for some road segments
- Limitations in data granularity for certain attributes

### Technical Constraints
- Need for efficient handling of large datasets for browser-based visualization
- Need to accommodate various device types and screen sizes
- Browser compatibility requirements (support for modern browsers)
- Performance optimization for map rendering with numerous data points

### Legal and Compliance Requirements
- Adherence to Queensland Government data usage policies and licensing
- Privacy considerations when displaying crash data
- Attribution requirements for data sources
- Disclaimer requirements regarding data accuracy and usage

### Resource Constraints
- Development timeline and milestone requirements
- Hosting and infrastructure budget considerations
- Maintenance and update resource allocation

## Data Update Strategy

- Implement automated monthly data synchronization with Queensland Government datasets
- Clearly indicate data currency on the platform
- Provide visual differentiation for preliminary vs. confirmed data
- Maintain a data update log accessible to users

## Accessibility Requirements

- Compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
- Alternative text for map features
- Keyboard navigable interface
- Screen reader compatibility for data visualization elements
- Color schemes that accommodate color blindness
- Text size adjustment capabilities

This PRD outlines the fundamental requirements for the road.engineering platform, establishing clear guidelines for development while allowing for iterative improvements based on user feedback and evolving data availability.
