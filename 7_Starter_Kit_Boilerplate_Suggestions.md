## 6. Getting Started Guide

To kickstart the road.engineering project with the recommended starter kit combination:

### 6.1 Backend Setup

```bash
# Clone the Express TypeScript PostGIS starter
git clone https://github.com/simonplend/express-typescript-starter road-engineering-api
cd road-engineering-api

# Install dependencies
npm install
npm install @types/geojson typeorm-spatial pg postgis

# Set up database
# Make sure PostgreSQL with PostGIS is installed
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE road_engineering;"
psql -U postgres -d road_engineering -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;"

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set the database connection

# Run initial migrations
npm run migration:run

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 6.2 Frontend Setup

```bash
# Create Next.js project with Leaflet starter
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/colbyfayock/next-leaflet-starter road-engineering-frontend
cd road-engineering-frontend

# Install additional dependencies
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node @types/leaflet
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer @tanstack/react-query axios

# Set up TypeScript
touch tsconfig.json
npx tsc --init

# Set up Tailwind CSS
npx tailwindcss init -p

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 6.3 Initial Integration

```bash
# In the frontend directory, create an API client
mkdir -p src/services
touch src/services/api.ts

# Example API client configuration
# src/services/api.ts
import axios from 'axios';

const baseURL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3001/api';

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});

export default api;
```

By starting with these recommended boilerplates and following the integration instructions, the road.engineering project can be bootstrapped quickly while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to specific requirements. These starter kits provide solid foundations for AI-assisted development, allowing the team to focus on the unique aspects of crash data visualization and analysis rather than basic setup and configuration.
